# Logspout with Fluentd

This dockerfile will build a logspout container with fluentd support.  Just run `docker build` and it will create it for you.

Temporarily moved the logspout-fluentd to come from github.com/michaeltravisuk/logspout-fluentd, due to https://github.com/segmentio/logspout-fluentd/issues/1

Upstream is github.com/segmentio/logspout-fluentd
